# Developer Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to our project. Your efforts are greatly appreciated and play a vital role in improving and growing our work!

## Proposing a New Rule

To add a new rule, please follow these steps:

- [Create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yeonjuan/html-eslint/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) to discuss the new rule being added.
- Generate the scaffolding for the new rule with the `yarn run new-rule <rule-name>` command. This command will generate the documentation for the rule, the implementation code, and the test code.
- Sync the documentation by running: `yarn run build`
- The ASTs used by html-eslint are generated by [es-html-parser](https://github.com/yeonjuan/es-html-parser). You can debug the ASTs [here](https://yeonjuan.github.io/es-html-parser/).
- Once the implementation of the rule is complete, create a pull request to review it.

## Proposing a Rule Change

To modify an existing rule, please follow these steps:

- [Create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yeonjuan/html-eslint/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) to discuss the changes to the rule.
- Make changes to the rule in the following file: `packages/eslint-plugin/lib/rules/<rule-name>.js`
- Add test cases for the rule change in the following file: `packages/eslint-plugin/tests/rules/<rule-name>.test.js`
- Run the tests using the command: `yarn test`
- Once the changes are complete, create a pull request to review them.
