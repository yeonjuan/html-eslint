# use-baseline

This rule enforces the use of baseline features.

## What is Baseline?

[Baseline](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/) is an effort by the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) that provides clear information about which web platform features work across [core browser set](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/#how-do-features-become-part-of-baseline%3F) today.

Baseline features are available across popular browsers. Baseline has two stages:

- **Newly available**: The feature works across the latest devices and browser versions. The feature might not work in older devices or browsers.
- **Widely available**: The feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It's been available across browsers for at least 2Â½ years (30 months).

Prior to being newly available, a feature has **Limited availability** when it's not yet available across all browsers.

## How to use

```js,.eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    "@html-eslint/use-baseline": "error",
  },
};
```

## Rule Details

This rule warns when it finds any of the following:

- An element that isn't widely available.
- An attribute that isn't widely available.
- An attribute value that isn't widely available.

The data is provided via the [web-features](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-features) package.

### Options

This rule has an object option:

```ts
"@html-eslint/use-baseline": ["error", {
  "available": "newly" | "widely" | number; // default: "widely"
}]
```

#### available: "widely"

If `"widely"` is used as an option, this rule allows features that are at the Baseline widely available stage: features that have been available across browsers for at least 30 months.

#### available: "newly"

If `"newly"` is used as an option, this rule allows features that are at the Baseline newly available stage: features that have been supported on all core browsers for less than 30 months.

#### available: number

If an integer `number` is used as an option, this rule allows features that became Baseline newly available that year, or earlier. (minimum: 2000)
